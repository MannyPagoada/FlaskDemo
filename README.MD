# Flask Demo

## Goal

    I will be making a simple flask web application to understand it better. I want to be able to launch the framework and play with API's.

## Steps

### Prep

1. Make sure you install python3 and python3-pip
2. Run command to get flask
3. Get tools to be able to make api request

   sudo apt install python3
   sudo apt install python3-pip
   sudo pip3 install flask
   pip3 install request

### Set up

1. make a pythonfile to run flask, I am using flaskdemo.py
2. Add the shebang to the python script (its like bash scripting shebang but use python3)
   #!/bin/python3
