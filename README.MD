# Flask Demo

## Goal

I will be making a simple flask web application to understand it better. I want to be able to launch the framework and play with API's.

## Steps

### Prep

    sudo apt install python3
    sudo apt install python3-pip
    sudo pip3 install flask
    pip3 install request.

1. Make sure you install python3 and python3-pip
2. Run command to get flask
3. Get tools to be able to make api request

### Set up

1. make a pythonfile to run flask, I am using flaskdemo.py
2. Add the shebang to the python script (its like bash scripting shebang but use python3)
   #!/bin/python3
3. Import flask by:
   from flask import Flask
4. create and app variable that the uses the Flask function
5. We are going to add python decorator with @ its so function. works almost like components from react but with functions

### New purpose

This web application is now going to tell me the time in portugal using more modules. To render the index html we are going to use render_timplate. We are also going to import datetime and pytz. datetime gives current date and time while pytze is a libary for handling diffrent timezone.
